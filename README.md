# Deep-Compression-with-autoencoder
 In addition to the implementation of deep encoder we will study the effect of different distorsions and noise on this model that is used in our case for <h3> compression </h3> <br>
 In our case we will deal with these type of distorsions: <br>
- Poisson noise <br>
- White  noise <br>
- Salt & pepper  noise <br>
- Speckle noise <br>
- Gaussian <br>
- Median 3*3 and 5*5 <br>
- Mean 3*3 and 5*5 <br>
For this we will use MNIST dataset (60000 for training et 10000 for test) <br> 
Images are in grayscale with 28x28 pixels

Now we will move to our model "Autoencoder"
